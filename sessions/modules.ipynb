    "To manage installations and dependencies, most people use a pacakge manager. The most common one is [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) (which replaced `easy_install` some years ago), which is the package manager recommended by the Python organization. _pip_ installs packages that were uploaded (e.g. _deployed_) to [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/), the Python Package Index, which is the main repository for Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, scientific pacakges (such as Numpy and Scipy) sometimes have non-Python dependencies, mostly C and Fortran code, and these dependecies can be hard to compile and link - especially on standard Windows machines. Therefore, [Continuum](http://continuum.io/) started the [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/) project. *conda* is an alternative to *pip*, able to install Python packages, but it can also do more, as it can install non-Python software (even *R*). So *conda* can install Python packages with non-Python dependencies much more smoothly.\n",
